# Guildance

gialib's vim and other dotfiles, partially referenced [YARD](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles).

## Install Vim dotfile

Both automatic installation and manual installation are available.

### Automatic Installation

```sh
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gialib/dotfiles/master/install`"
```

It might take a long time for the first time installation because under the hood it will:

- Upgrade package management program
- Install vim
- Install vim Plugins

### Manual Installation

* clone the project

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/gialib/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  ```

* see all available rake tasks

  ```sh
  rake -T
  ```

* dry run and print all shell commands that will be executed

  ```sh
  DEBUG=1 rake
  ```

* execute default task

  ```sh
  rake
  ```

### Upgrade

```sh
rake update
```

### Uninstall

```sh
rake uninstall
```

Note: Uninstallation will keep vim and plugins, but plugins won't be loaded because there's no configuration file.
